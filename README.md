A4: Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction
log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 100 W 200
(Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and
deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300, D 300 , W 200, D 100 Then, the output should be: 500

A2: Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by
N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class
b) Highest score and lowest score of class
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency

A9: Write a Python program to compute following computation on matrix:
a) Addition of two matrices B) Subtraction of two matrices
c) Multiplication of two matrices d) Transpose of a matrix

B11: a) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training
program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular student
attended training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.
b) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended
training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search

B14: Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for
sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Selection Sort
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores

B16: Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for
sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display top
five scores.

C19: Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of
second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly
one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last
node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club member‘s
information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b) Compute total number of members of club
c) Display members
d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.




C22:Second year Computer Engineering class, set A of students like Vanilla Ice-cream and set B
of students like butterscotch ice-cream. Write C++ program to store two sets using linked
list. compute and displaya) Set of students who like both vanilla and butterscotch
b) Set of students who like either vanilla or butterscotch or not both
c) Number of students who like neither vanilla nor butterscotch


D25: A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically,
punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is
a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and
observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome
is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the original-in a
palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with functionsa) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

D26: In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
(),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well
parenthesized or not.


E29: Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation
of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then
the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating
job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue

E31: A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made
at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one-dimensional array.
Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either
end of the deque

E32: Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served basis.
Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system using
circular queue using array.
